Birthday paradox
================

In probability theory, the [birthday problem or birthday paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem) concerns the probability that, in a set of n randomly chosen people, some pair of them will have the same birthday. By the pigeonhole principle, the probability reaches 100% when the number of people reaches 367 (since there are 366 possible birthdays, including February 29). However, 99.9% probability is reached with just 70 people, and 50% probability with 23 people.
